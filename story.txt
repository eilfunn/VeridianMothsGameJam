Player meets NPC1 outside
NPC1: You're here to get rid of the ghost, right? Please say yes.
OHH!!! GREAT!!!
NPC2 probably already told you over the phone but NPC3 got themself locked in the big ol' mansion
with a really angry ghost. We told them not to go but they did anyway. Does anyone ever listen here?
Anyway, we can't contact them and we're pretty sure the ghost is holding them captive.
We really must hurry. Follow me!
Player moves PC to follow NPC1 to a house
PC meets NPC2 in the house
NPC2: Oh great!! You must be PC. Please help us!! NPC3 is trapped in the mansion and the door is locked. We can't get to them.
I think that ghost is keeping them there. No one has been inside that mansion for decades because of the ghosts.

PC can leave and explore town, if they try to go to the mansion, error message: Oh no.. I forgot to unpack my things at home
